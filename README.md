## Description

- A # represents the first level title, and the content below it represents the content of one page in the left and right pages

- The two #'s represent the secondary title, while the content below represents the content of one page in the left and right pages

- The three #'s represent three-level titles, while the content below represents the content of one page in the upper and lower pages

- For special effects, please refer to examples

- For example, the '[7-9 | 10-12 | 12-15]' after the code indicates that the code can be highlighted by line segments

- The '<! -- Slide: data auto animate -->` Indicates that if the current page is switched to the next page, the same part will have a transition animation, and different parts will be displayed. In short, it can produce great results

- The `<! -- after the text Element: class="fragment" -->` Indicates that a class is added to the current element, and the 'fragment' class enables the element to be displayed step by step instead of being displayed at once

- If you want to add a style to an element, you can draw inferences from one example, such as'<! ' element: style="color:red" -->`

- The '<! -- Slide: class="column 2" -->` Allows the current page to be displayed in two columns

- '* Content *' will make the content text smaller. You can also use '<small>content</small>`

- Some commonly used color labels are preset, such as'<yellow>','<red>','<green>', and'<green>'
